# GO Chatbots

This repo contains all of the research done over the course of my final Master Thesis at the Swisscom Digital Lab.

The folder **Production** presents a system for training Goal-Oriented Chatbots, and it is not aimed for research purposes.

The folder **Research** contains all the code for researching. It contains two other subfolders and one README file which explains how to use them and produce the results.
