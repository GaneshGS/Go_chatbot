# GO Chatbots

This repo contains all of the research done over the course of my final Master Thesis at the Swisscom Digital Lab. It consists the following folders:

- The folder **Production** presents a system for training Goal-Oriented Chatbots, and it is not aimed for research purposes.

- The folder **Research** contains all the code for researching. It contains two other subfolders and one README file which explains how to use them and produce the results.

- The folder **Results** contains all results and the respective plots. It contains another README describing the organization of the results.
