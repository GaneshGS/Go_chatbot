# Research

This folder contains the research code for the Transfer Learning in Goal-Oriented Chatbots.

The folder **TC-Bot-Restaurant** contains the code for training a GO Chatbot in the Restaurant Reservation domain, such that we transfer
the knowledge from the Movie Booking domain. 

The folder **TC-Bot-Tourist-Info** contains the code for training a GO Chatbot in the Tourist Info domain, such that we transfer
the knowledge from the Restaurant Booking domain. 


The details for the training process for both domains are explained in the README files inside the respective folders.
